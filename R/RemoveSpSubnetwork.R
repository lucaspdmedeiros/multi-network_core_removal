RemoveSpSubnetwork = function(s, n, mat, sub_id) {
  # Performs s simulations of random removal of n species from a subnetwork embedded in a complete 
  # network.
  # 
  # Args:
  #   s: number of simulations (number of different complete networks that will be generated)
  #   n: number of species that will be removed
  #   mat: bipartite matrix with plants in rows and animals in columns
  #   sub_id: data frame with 2 columns identifying the plants (1st column) and animals 
  #           (2nd column) that belong to the subnetwork (1: belong; 0: do not belong)
  #
  # Returns:
  #   s complete networks, each with n species removed from the desired subnetwork
